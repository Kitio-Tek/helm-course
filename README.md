# Production-Grade Helm Workflows:  Mastery

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Bitnami Breaking Changes** - Bitnami has removed older image tags from Docker Hub. If you encounter `ErrImagePull` errors when installing WordPress, NGINX, or PostgreSQL charts, please see [**BITNAMI-WORKAROUND.md**](BITNAMI-WORKAROUND.md) for updated commands and solutions.

This repository contains production-grade Helm workflows implemented throughout a complete, end-to-end Helm path.
It focuses on real-world usage, best practices, and patterns for Kubernetes environments.

Welcome! I’m glad you’re here, and I hope this repository provides strong value for engineers looking to move beyond basic Helm usage and adopt reliable, maintainable, and scalable deployment workflows.

Here are a few tips for you to best navigate the contents of this repository:

1. The folder `_exercises` folder contains hands-on, practical workflows designed to reinforce production-ready Helm usage.
They are organized by topic and follow the same structure as the overall learning path, making it easy to map exercises to their corresponding concepts and implementations.
   
2. Each major topic is represented by one or more directories containing all relevant Helm charts, templates, values files, and configuration.
Some topics include multiple folders to illustrate different approaches or deployment strategies, but naming is kept consistent to make navigation straightforward
